    <h2><p><a name="Home">Historical places Ethiopia</a></p></h2> 
    <p>
<br>
    
   <fieldset> <p>Ethiopia is an ancient country whose unique cultural heritage, rich history and remarkable 
        biodiversity are reflected in a tally of nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites –more than any other country 
        in Africa. Within its borders, you'll find the world's fourth-holiest Islamic city, along with the oldest 
        continuously-occupied town south of the Sahara.

        Compelling antiquities include the medieval rock-hewn churches of Lalibela and Gheralta, palaces and 
        temples dating back 3,000 years, the magnificent 17th century castles of Gondar, and the oldest human 
        fossils unearthed anywhere on the planet.
        
        Add to this the beautiful Simien and Bale Mountains, the spectacular volcanic landscapes of the Danakil
         Depression, and a wealth of mammals and birds found nowhere else in the world, and it's little wonder 
         that Ethiopia has become the most attractive and popular emergent tourist destination in Africa.<p><iframe frameborder="1" width="600" height="400"

      <p>Tourist destinations include Ethiopia's collection of national parks (including Semien Mountains National Park),<br>
           and historic sites, such as the cities of Axum, Lalibela and Gondar, Harar Jugol walled city, Negash Mosque, <br>
           in Negash and Sof Omar Caves.<br>

        <p>Developed in the 1960s, tourism declined greatly during the later 1970s and the 1980s under the Derg.<br>
         Recovery began in the 1990s, but growth has been constrained by the lack of suitable hotels and other <br>
         infrastructure, despite a boom in construction of small and medium-sized hotels and restaurants, and by <br>
         the effects of drought and political instability.<br>
         One encouraging aspect is the growing popularity of ecotourism, with significant potential for growth<br> 
         in Ethiopia. Travel retail sales are expected to continue to grow, posting an increase of 7% in 2006 <br>
         and with a forecast 5% increase in 2007. Sales are driven primarily by expanding interest in ecotourism <br>
         packages, including adventure travel, trekking[2] and walking safaris that are making up much of the<br>
         tour operators' revenues.</p>
